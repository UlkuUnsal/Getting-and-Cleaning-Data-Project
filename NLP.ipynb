But 36 people accused in connection with the blasts said it should not be screened until the trial is over. Mumbai High Court postponed the film's launch until 3 February.\\n\\nBlack Friday is based upon the novel of the same name written by journalist S Hussain Zaidi, which looks at the 15 explosions which rocked Mumbai on 12 March 1993. Director Anurag Kashyap said the film's release should not be delayed as the book has already been on sale for two years. \\\"If you have not gone against the book, then how can you go against the movie?\\\" Mr Kashyap's lawyer Mihir Desai said. This is the second time that those accused in connection with the blasts have sought legal intervention regarding the film.\\n\\nThey previously asked that a line from the movie's poster, which claimed the film portrayed \\\"the true story of the Bombay bomb blasts\\\", be removed. Their lawyer, Majeed Memon, said: \\\"We had argued that how can a film say it is telling the true story when the court itself is struggling to find the truth? \\\"So we said they should remove the line from their promotional posters and they did give us an assurance that they would do so.\\\" The Mumbai bombings case is one of India's longest-running trials. A special court was set up to hear the case and regular hearings have taken place there for the last nine years, with more than six hundred witnesses questioned.\\n\",\n          \"Blog reading explodes in America\\n\\nAmericans are becoming avid blog readers, with 32 million getting hooked in 2004, according to new research.\\n\\nThe survey, conducted by the Pew Internet and American Life Project, showed that blog readership has shot up by 58% in the last year. Some of this growth is attributable to political blogs written and read during the US presidential campaign. Despite the explosive growth, more than 60% of online Americans have still never heard of blogs, the survey found. Blogs, or web logs, are online spaces in which people can publish their thoughts, opinions or spread news events in their own words. Companies such as Google and Microsoft provide users with the tools to publish their own blogs.\\n\\nThe rise of blogs has spawned a new desire for immediate news and information, with six million Americans now using RSS aggregators. RSS aggregators are downloaded to PCs and are programmed to subscribe to feeds from blogs, news sites and other websites. The aggregators automatically compile the latest information published online from the blogs or news sites. Reading blogs remains far more popular than writing them, the survey found. Only 7% of the 120 million US adults who use the internet had created a blog or web-based diary. Getting involved is becoming more popular though, with 12% saying they had posted material or comments on other people's blogs.\\n\\nJust under one in 10 of the US's internet users read political blogs such as the Daily Kos or Instapundit during the US presidential campaign. Kerry voters were slightly more likely to read them than Bush voters. Blog creators were likely to be young, well-educated, net-savvy males with good incomes and college educations, the survey found. This was also true of the average blog reader, although the survey found there was a greater than average growth in blog readership among women and those in minorities. The survey was conducted during November and involved telephone surveys of 1,324 internet users.\\n\",\n          \"Wenger signs new deal\\n\\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger has signed a new contract to stay at the club until May 2008.\\n\\nWenger has ended speculation about his future by agreeing a long-term contract that takes him beyond the opening of Arsenal's new stadium in two years. He said: \\\"Signing a new contract just rubber-stamps my desire to take this club forward and fulfil my ambitions. \\\"I still have so much to achieve and my target is to drive this club on. These are exciting times for Arsenal.\\\"\\n\\nThe 55-year-old Frenchman told Arsenal's website www.arsenal.com: \\\"My intention has always been clear. I love this club and am very happy here.\\\" Wenger has won the title and the FA Cup three times each during his reign. Chairman Peter Hill-Wood said: \\\"We are absolutely delighted that Arsene has signed an extension to his contract. \\\"Since his arrival in 1996, he has revolutionised the club both on and off the pitch. \\\"As well as the six major honours he's won during his time here, Arsene has been a leading influence behind all the major initiatives at the club including the construction of our new training centre and also our new stadium.\\n\\n\\\"The club has continued to reap the benefits of Arsene's natural eye for unearthing footballing talent. \\\"We currently have a fantastic crop of young players coming through the ranks together with a number of world-class players who are playing a wonderful brand of football.\\\" Meanwhile, Arsenal director Danny Fiszman is looking for Wenger to stay beyond 2008. \\\"When we come towards the end of his contract we will both review the situation. I'm sure we will want him to stay on and I hope he will too,\\\" said Fiszman.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
